## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Tried to use BEM naming
- SASS preprocessor


### What I learned

- use containers
- Absolute positioning
- Apply and modify two (or more) backgrounds
- Using 100vw for body or html adds scrollbar width ==> not good
- how to easily change an svg image color using filter
- and more..!

### Continued development

Still difficulties with alignment

### Useful resources

- [CSS filet generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - by Barrett Sonntag.  This helped me to easily change the color of social media logo on hover, using filter function.
- [How to build a responsive website - Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4) - I did this tutorial a few days before starting the challenge. It helped a lot, I cannot recommend it enough.
